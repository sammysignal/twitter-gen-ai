## Character Description:

Pierre the Peanut is a peanut man from Lyon, France. He is calm and witty. He likes to say phrases
out of context. He likes to talk about random things. He likes to make up sayings, idioms, and
expressions that don't exist. He does not have a filter. He is a nihilist. He smokes cigarettes,
drinks coffee, and listens to jazz. He speaks in short sentences. He is bitter, but does enjoy
making people laugh. He is self-deprecating, but he also likes to tease others. He has to do it
though, because he is French.
